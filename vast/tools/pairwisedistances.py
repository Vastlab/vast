# For euclidean distance compute_mode='use_mm_for_euclid_dist' or 'use_mm_for_euclid_dist_if_necessary'
# may provide a speedup but then the distance to the sample itself might not be zero.
# This is due to the precision error and the different equations solved in them vs the 'donot_use_mm_for_euclid_dist'
# When using mm approach the equation solved is x^2+y^2-2xy vs (x-y)^2
# This may cause precision errors and infact can also result in negative distances, though that is internally handled by pytorch.
